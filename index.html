            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in terms of
                human capital. Human capital is defined by the Encyclopædia Britannica as “intangible collective
                resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population". The goal of personal
                infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents values. This results in three major
                tasks: the task of economic proxies in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor,
                etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of
                education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure. Essentially, personal infrastructure
                maps the human impact on infrastructure as it is related to the economy, individual growth, and social
                impact.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Engineers generally limit the term "infrastructure" to describe fixed
                assets that are in the form of a large network; in other words, hard infrastructure. Efforts to devise
                more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of
                the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets. One such
                definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets "where the system as a whole is
                intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement
                and refurbishment of its components"</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Land improvement and land development are general terms that in some
                contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer
                only to smaller-scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are
                typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the landowner. For example,
                an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the
                private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not
                infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be
                considered land improvements, not infrastructure </p>
